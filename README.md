Machine learning to classify emails as spam or not spam

## Assignment

Compare the performances of machine learning-based email spam detectors.
<br><br>
Task Details:
1. See the reference [1], it uses the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to identify spam emails.
2. Understand the concepts therein and the workflow.
3. Practice the code and run on your own machines/Kaggle.
4. Use two other machine learning algorithms (any two) to detect spam emails. 
5. Measure the accuracy (classification error rate) for each algorithm.
